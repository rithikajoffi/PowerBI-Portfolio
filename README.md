## Project 4: Zomato Dasboard

This Power BI dashboard analyzes restaurant data across India using a publicly available Zomato dataset. I performed extensive data transformation to clean and shape the dataset according to the dashboard requirements. The visualizations highlight restaurant distribution across cities, popular cuisine categories, rating-based pricing, and top-rated restaurants.

To enrich the geographic component of the analysis, I also web scraped the longitude and latitude coordinates of restaurant locations. This enabled me to plot their exact positions on interactive maps within the dashboard.
